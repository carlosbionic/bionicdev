  <p>A long time ago, around the year 2005 I decided part of my professional future. While I was on high school (and way before that) I had a somewhat passion about Mathematics. But on the last two or three years of high school I started to learn the basics of what is called <strong>Physics</strong>. By that time, I was fascinated by the fact that Mathematics can be directly applied to everyday situations like a heavy body falling to the ground. You can compute the time it takes to reach the ground knowing the value of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity">gravity</a>.</p>

  <p>But as time went by, I realized that my teachers kept insisting that practically everything in Physics was <i>approximated</i>. The value of the gravity was <i>approximated</i>, the position of an object was <i>approximated</i> (basically it depends on the object used to measure its position), etc. So I began wondering, is Physics an <i>exact science</i>?</p>

  <h2>What is Physics?</h2>
  <p>Physics is...</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Before continuing with my thoughts or opinions on the subject, let's start by quoting what some great historical scientists said about this.</p>
  
  <h2>Maths vs Physics</h2>
  <p>
    Mathematics can be considered an exact science in most cases (like \(2+2=4\) is as exact as something can be).
  </p>

  <h2>What does <i>exact</i> mean in this context?</h2>
  <p>When we talk about <i>exact</i>, we need to understand the context first.</p>
