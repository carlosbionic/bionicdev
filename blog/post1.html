  <p>A long time ago, around the year 2005 I decided part of my professional future. While I was on high school (and way before that) I had a somewhat passion about Mathematics. But on the last two or three years of high school I started to learn the basics of what is called <strong>Physics</strong>.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    The Ancient Greeks made pancakes called τηγανίτης (tēganitēs), ταγηνίτης (tagēnitēs)<sup>[2]</sup> or ταγηνίας (tagēnias),<sup>[3]</sup> all words deriving from τάγηνον (tagēnon), "frying pan".<sup>[4]</sup> The earliest attested references on tagenias are in the works of the 5th century BC poets Cratinus<sup>[5]</sup> and Magnes.<sup>[6]</sup> Tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast.

  <h2>Regional varieties</h2>
  <h3>Africa</h3>
  <p>Lahoh is a pancake-like bread originating in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen.[18][19] It is often eaten along with honey, ghee and tea. During lunch, lahoh is sometimes consumed with curry, soup or stew.</p>
  <h3>Europe</h3>
  <p>Eastern-Slavic cuisines have a long tradition of pancake cooking and include a large variety of pancake types. In Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, pancakes may be breakfast food, appetizer, main course, or even dessert.</p>

  <h3>Asia</h3>
  <p>Banana pancakes are a menu item in Western-oriented backpackers' cafes in Asian countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, and China. This has elicited the term Banana Pancake Trail.</p>
  <h3>Americas</h3>
  <p>American and Canadian pancakes (sometimes called hotcakes, griddlecakes, or flapjacks) are usually served at breakfast, in a stack of two or three pancakes topped with real or artificial maple syrup and butter, and often served with sides such as bacon, toast, eggs or sausage. Other popular topping alternatives include jam, peanut butter, nuts, fruit, honey, powdered sugar, whipped cream, cane syrup, and molasses.</p>
