  <p>A long time ago, around the year 2005 I decided part of my professional future. While I was on high school (and way before that) I had a somewhat passion about Mathematics. But on the last two or three years of high school I started to learn the basics of what is called <strong>Physics</strong>. By that time, I was fascinated by the fact that Mathematics can be directly applied to everyday situations like a heavy body falling to the ground. You can compute the time it takes to reach the ground knowing the value of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity">gravity</a>.</p>

  <p>But as time went by, I realized that my teachers kept insisting that practically everything in Physics was <i>approximated</i>. The value of the gravity was <i>approximated</i>, the position of an object was <i>approximated</i> (basically it depends on the object used to measure its position), etc. So I began wondering, is Physics an <i>exact science</i>?</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Before continuing with my thoughts or opinions on the subject, let's start by quoting what some great historical scientists said about this.</p>
  
  <p>
    The Ancient Greeks made pancakes called τηγανίτης (tēganitēs), ταγηνίτης (tagēnitēs)<sup>[2]</sup> or ταγηνίας (tagēnias),<sup>[3]</sup> all words deriving from τάγηνον (tagēnon), "frying pan".<sup>[4]</sup> The earliest attested references on tagenias are in the works of the 5th century BC poets Cratinus<sup>[5]</sup> and Magnes.<sup>[6]</sup> Tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast.
  </p>
  <h2>Regional varieties</h2>
  <h3>Africa</h3>
  <p>Lahoh is a pancake-like bread originating in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen.[18][19] It is often eaten along with honey, ghee and tea. During lunch, lahoh is sometimes consumed with curry, soup or stew.</p>
  <h3>Europe</h3>
  <p>Eastern-Slavic cuisines have a long tradition of pancake cooking and include a large variety of pancake types. In Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, pancakes may be breakfast food, appetizer, main course, or even dessert.</p>

  <h3>Asia</h3>
  <p>Banana pancakes are a menu item in Western-oriented backpackers' cafes in Asian countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, and China. This has elicited the term Banana Pancake Trail.</p>
  <h3>Americas</h3>
  <p>American and Canadian pancakes (sometimes called hotcakes, griddlecakes, or flapjacks) are usually served at breakfast, in a stack of two or three pancakes topped with real or artificial maple syrup and butter, and often served with sides such as bacon, toast, eggs or sausage. Other popular topping alternatives include jam, peanut butter, nuts, fruit, honey, powdered sugar, whipped cream, cane syrup, and molasses.</p>
  <h2>Common Ingridients</h2>
  <p>A <code>ul</code> tag is a good example of why you should set good default <code>font-size</code> and <code>line-height</code> above the context of simply paragraph tags. Let any sort of article content get sizing from its parents.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Flour or other starchy base.</li>
    <li>Pure deliciousness.</li>
  </ul>  


  <p>
  When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
  \[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\]
