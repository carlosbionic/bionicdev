    Physics is a beautiful discipline, my favourite of the exact sciences (recommended reading: <a href="http://deusdev.tech/blog/is-physics-an-exact-science/" target="_blank">Is Physics an Exact Science?</a>). As a Physics student I had to read and study a good amount of books, both technical and popular.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this article I list ten of the books I read and/or studied, and find the most interesting ones to recommend. Each one of them has a short description about my thoughts of that book.
  </p>

  <h2>Richard Feynman: The Feynman Lectures on Physics</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="feynman.jpg" alt="Feynman Lectures 1 Book">
  </figure>

  <p>
    The Feynman Lectures on Physics are three books written after a series of lectures were given by Richard Feynman from 1961 to 1963. The first one is about Mechanics, the second about Electromagnetism and the third about Quantum Mechanics. Richard Feynman is one of the most famous Physicist and teachers because of the way and methods he uses in his lectures. He is fun and very creative in his explanations. When reading the books, there aren't many equations, but the focus is in understanding the concepts more than the maths.
  </p>

  <h2>Albert Einstein, Leopold Infeld: The Evolution of Physics</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="evolutionofphysicseinstein.jpg" alt="Resnik Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    In this book the authors explain different concepts about Physics in a way that a person without Mathematics knowledge can follow along. They claim the book is written for an audience who isn't necessarily well versed in topics like Mathematics and Physics, and they are trully right. This doesn't mean a Physics student or major will get bored reading this book, quite the contrary. I first read this book when I was around 16 years old, and I read it again when I finished my Physics masters (31 years old).
  </p>

  <h2>Michael White, John Gribbin: Stephen Hawking, A Life in Science</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="hawkinglifescience.jpg" alt="Hawking Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century. This book is the first biografy of this genius, author of <em>A brief history of time</em>. The authors talk about the life and work of Hawking, explaining the importance of his investigations in a way anybody can understand it.
  </p>

  <h2>David J. Griffiths: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="griffiths.jpg" alt="Griffiths Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    This is a classic textbook dedicated to Quantum Mechanics. It is not dedicated to readers with no knowledge of general Physics or Mathematics. Explanations are clear and concise. At the end of each chapter there are a good number of exercises to practice the concepts. Topics include <em>wave functions, Schr√∂dinger equation, identical particles, symmetries, perturbation theories, scattering</em> and other specific applications.
  </p>

  <h2>J. J. Sakurai: Modern Quantum Mechanics</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="sakurai.jpg" alt="Sakurai Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    This is another great textbook for Quantum Mechanics. It is intended to students who are well versed in Mathematics and Physics. It is also required to have at least a basic understanding of the core concepts of Quantum Physics, since this book focuses heavily on Quantum Mechanics technicalities. At the end of each chapter there are exercises to practice. Topics include <em>quantum dynamics, angular momentum, symmetries, approximation methods, identical particles</em> and  <em>scattering</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>John David Jackson: Classical Electrodynamics</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="jacksonelectro.jpg" alt="Jackson Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    Classical Electrodynamics by Jackson is a book I highly recommend to anyone studying or reviewing such concepts. It is not a book for people who don't have basic understanding of Physics and Mathematics. It is also recommended to have a basic understanding of electricity and magnetism. Topics include <em>electrostatics, boundary-value problems, multipoles, magnetostatics, Maxwell equations, electromagnetic waves, waveguides, radiation, scattering, special theory of relativity</em>, among others.
  </p>

  <h2>Steven H. Strogatz: Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="strogatz.jpg" alt="Strogatz Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    If you are curious about what <em>chaos</em> is, this is a great book you can start with. The author is great at explaining the concepts so anyone can understand them. At the beginning the Mathematics are not so present, but as the text advances it gets heavier. The book has applications to Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Engineering. Topics include <em>flows, bifurcations, phase plane, limit cycles, Lorenz equations, maps, fractals, strange attractors.</em>
  </p>

  <h2>Edward Ott: Chaos in Dynamical Systems</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="ottchaos.jpg" alt="Ott Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    Following on the <em>chaos</em> topic, this is another great book you can read only if you are interested in getting deeper into this theory. This book is intended to students who have a good understanding of Physics and Chaos theory. I recommend that if you want to jump in on a book like this, first review the basic concepts of chaos theory and physics. This book also includes applications to quantum theory with chaos. Topics include <em>maps, strange attractors, fractal dimension, chaotic sets, quasiperiodicity, multifractals, quantum chaos</em>, among others.
  </p>

  <h2>Resnik, Halliday, Krane: Physics</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="resnik.jpg" alt="Resnik Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    This book is a great choice for those who love Physics and have a basic knowledge of Mathematics and Calculus. The topics for the first volume include <em>measurements, one direction movements, vectors, 2D and 3D movements, forces, Newton's laws, dynamics, energy, collisions, rotation, rigid body, oscilations, gravitation, fluids, sound waves, special theory of relativity, temperature, kinetic theory</em>, among others. As you can see, the topics are vastly wide, but each of them is treated as something of an Introduction. You can study each topic alone on its own, finding books and many resources. But this book is a starting point on each topic.
  </p>

  <h2>Herbert Goldstein: Classical Mechanics</h2>

  <figure>
    <img src="goldstein.jpg" alt="Goldstein Book" style="max-width: 400px;">
  </figure>

  <p>
    This textbook is like the Bible of Classical Mechanics for every student of Physics. Either you hate it or you love it; there is no middle point. It is a very technical reading, and you need to have a good knowledge of Mathematics and Calculus, as well as basic Physics. Topics include <em>variational principles, Lagrange equations, central forces, rigid body, oscillations, special theory of relativity, Hamilton equations, Hamilton-Jacobi theory, classical chaos</em> and <em>perturbation theory</em>. After studying with this book you will have a solid understanding of Classical Mechanics.
  </p>  

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  
  <p>
    You have reached the end of the article. There are many other books I could recommend, but this list is for the ones I find more interesting and helpful for both students and non students. Once you start reading one or more of this books, you will find other books on similar topics.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope you found it interesting and helpful!
