  <p>A long time ago, around the year 2005 I decided part of my professional future. While I was on high school (and way before that) I had a somewhat passion about Mathematics. But on the last two or three years of high school I started to learn the basics of what is called <strong>Physics</strong>. By that time, I was fascinated by the fact that Mathematics can be directly applied to everyday situations like a heavy body falling to the ground. You can compute the time it takes to reach the ground knowing the value of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" target="_blank">gravity</a>. Physics is one of the <i>exact sciences</i>.</p>

  <p>But as time went by, I realized that practically everything in Physics was <i>approximated</i>. The value of the gravity was <i>approximated</i>, the position of an object was <i>approximated</i> (it depends on the object used to measure its position), etc. So I began wondering, is Physics really an <i>exact science</i>? I mean, if the measurements we make are not perfect, why do we call this science <i>exact</i>?</p>

  <p>Science can be divided into different branches: physical sciences (astronomy, physics, chemistry), biological sciences (biology, medicine), social sciences (anthropology, economics).</p>  

  <p>Natural science is another branch, which works on natural phenomena based on observation and experimentation. <i>Physics</i> is also considered as one of the natural sciences.</p>

  <h2>What is Physics?</h2>
  <p>Physics is the science that studies things like the movements of bodies, gravity, electricity and magnetism. It does so by observation and experimentation to begin with. You observe a phenomenon, for example a falling apple. Then you observe a different falling body, maybe a heavy iron ball. And you can ask yourself something like <i>do the two bodies fall at the same time?</i> Here comes the <i>experimentation</i> part, where you let different bodies fall from the same height, and <i>measure</i> the height over time (how the height changes as time goes by).</p>

  <p>Once you made observations and experimentation, you begin by making <i>theories</i>. Thanks to the theory of gravity by Newton, we know that <i>all bodies in vacuum fall with the same acceleration, independently of the mass</i>.</p>
  
  <h2>Maths and Physics</h2>
  <p>
    Mathematics can be considered an exact science in most cases (like \(2+2=4\) is as exact as something can be). In Mathematics you make a series of assumptions and from those you obtain results (deductions).
  </p>

  <p>Mathematics is largely used in Physics to explain different phenomena. In Physics you also start from a series of assumptions and then make deductions. But the difference is that in Physics the assumptions are generally not perfect. For example you can make the assumption that the mass of an object does not change when falling to the ground. Sometimes this assumption can be very precise, but other times it may not be the case.</p>

  <h2>What does <i>exact</i> mean in this context?</h2>
  <p>When we talk about <i>exact</i>, we need to understand the context first. As we said before, Physics makes deductions from a series of assumptions. While the assumptions can be approximated, the deductions made are <i>logical</i>.</p>

  <p>When we say that <i>Physics is an exact science</i> we are talking about the process of deduction from the assumptions. The deductions are made in a Mathematical way, which is <i>exact</i>.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>To summarize, we can safely say that <i>Physics is an exact science</i>. But we need to be sure we understand what <i>exact</i> really mean in this context.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Assumptions are made for a specific problem, but this assumptions are not always exact (perfect).</li>
    <li>We make deductions from those assumptions.</li>
    <li>Deductions are made in a Mathematical way, so those are <i>exact</i>.</li>
  </ul>
